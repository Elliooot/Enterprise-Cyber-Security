## Phone Phreaking (1955)
**Overview:**
One of the earliest examples of hacking, phreakers exploited vulnerabilities in the telephone network, 
especially the analog systems used by AT&T in the U.S., to make free long-distance calls.
They discovered that specific audio tones could manipulate the switching systems used by operators to place calls.

**Impact**
This incident exposed the inherent weaknesses in the analog telephone system and became a forerunner to modern-day hacking.
The compromise raised concerns over the security of critical communication infrastructure and 
paved the way for future developments in telecommunications security.

**Lessons Learned**
1. Security on hidden mechanisms fails
2. Need for better Encryption
3. User Awareness
