## Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS, 1965)
### Overview:

The 1965 CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) incident involved a breach in one of the earliest time-sharing computer systems developed at MIT. 
A vulnerability in the CTSS allowed users to access the systemâ€™s password file, exposing user credentials. 
This incident occurred when a system error caused the passwords to be printed out along with a message 
on a shared printer, making them visible to anyone using the system.

### Impact:
The incident highlighted the risks associated with shared computer resources and exposed a serious flaw in system security. 
This was one of the earliest recognized breaches in computing history and led to greater scrutiny of multi-user systems. 
It showcased how security vulnerabilities could impact the confidentiality and privacy of users.

### Lessons Learned:
1. **Data Protection**: The incident underscored the importance of protecting sensitive information, such as user passwords, especially in shared systems.
2. **System Monitoring**: Developers realized the need for improved system monitoring and error handling to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.
3. **User Authentication**: Stronger authentication measures became a focus of research, leading to the development of more secure ways to manage user credentials.
