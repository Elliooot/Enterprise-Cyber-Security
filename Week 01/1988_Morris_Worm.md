## Morris Worm (1988)
### Overview:
The 1988 Morris Worm was one of the first major computer worms to spread across the internet. 
Created by Robert Tappan Morris, a graduate student at Cornell, the worm was intended as an experimental program to gauge the size of the internet. 
However, a flaw in its code caused it to rapidly replicate and infect a significant number of systems, 
including those at universities, research labs, and military sites, ultimately disabling around 10% of all connected machines.

### Impact:
The Morris Worm caused widespread disruption, slowing or shutting down infected systems and highlighting the vulnerability of early internet infrastructure. 
This incident was a wake-up call about the destructive potential of malicious code and computer worms. 
The financial impact was significant, with system administrators dedicating time and resources to remove the worm and restore affected systems. 
Morris was eventually prosecuted, leading to the first conviction under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).

### Lessons Learned:
1. Importance of Secure Coding
2. Cybersecurity Preparedness
3. Legal and Ethical Accountability
