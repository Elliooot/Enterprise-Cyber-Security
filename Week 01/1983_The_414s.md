## The 414s (1983)
### Overview:
The 1983 "The 414s" incident involved a group of six teenage hackers, who broke into multiple high-profile computer systems, 
including those at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. 
Using simple hacking techniques and a home computer with a modem, they exploited weak security on early networks.
The group gained unauthorized access to systems across the country.

### Impact:
This incident received widespread media coverage and brought national attention to the vulnerabilities of computer systems. 
It led to public concern about cybersecurity and the potential for unauthorized access to sensitive information. 
The event prompted a U.S. Senate hearing on computer security, ultimately influencing the development of stronger cybersecurity laws, 
including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) of 1986.

### Lessons Learned:
1. Need for Stronge Legislation
2. System Securityy Awareness
3. Early Warning of Hacking Threats
